# Animal-Rescue-Shelter-Management-Suite

Software developed to meet the needs of my local animal rescue over several years. 

The package includes: 

+ Two Firebase Progressive WebApps that can be easily exported to iOS or android or hosted as websites. These function as sign-in and volunteer databases for the shelter and are plug and play, after registering a free API key from firebase and entering your shelter's details. They are built with Ionic 3. They both have backend management components allowing for export to CSV. 

+ A php Twitter Bot that interfaces with the latest petFinder API to automatically share your rescue's pets that are available for adoption.

+ A php mailer that lets you automatically solicit donations or remind volunteers who haven't come in recently. 

+ Custom RescueGroups CSS Stylesheet to make their iframe look more modern and scale to modern browsers.

+ List of AdGrant Keywords for animal rescues. Saturation of terms allows you to optimally narrow your locality focus. 

I will document each of these over the next several weeks, and please open an issue if you have any questions. This software has greatly helped the animal shelter I volunteer at and I sincerely hope it can save a few others a lot of time in their mission to aid animals in need of homes. 

Thanks!
